📊 Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
Credit risk analysis is a crucial task in the financial sector to determine whether a loan applicant is likely to default.
This project uses machine learning techniques to classify customers into low-risk and high-risk categories based on their financial and demographic attributes.
The goal is to assist financial institutions in data-driven decision making, reducing losses while approving eligible customers efficiently.
🎯 Objectives
Analyze customer financial data and identify important risk factors
Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
Handle imbalanced datasets effectively
Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
Compare model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics
🗂 Dataset
Publicly available credit risk dataset
Contains customer information such as:
Age
Income
Credit history
Loan amount
Employment status
Default risk label
(Dataset is used strictly for academic and learning purposes.)
