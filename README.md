## 📌 Overview
Credit Risk Analysis is a data-driven approach used by financial institutions to evaluate whether a loan applicant is likely to default.  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to classify customers into **low-risk** and **high-risk** categories using historical financial data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Analyze customer financial behavior  
✔ Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
✔ Handle imbalanced datasets using SMOTE  
✔ Build and evaluate multiple ML models  
✔ Compare models using industry-relevant metrics  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Public credit risk dataset  
- Features include:
  - Applicant age
  - Annual income
  - Credit history
  - Loan amount
  - Employment status
  - Risk label  

> 📌 Dataset used strictly for academic learning purposes.
